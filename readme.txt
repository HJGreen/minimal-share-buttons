A social share plugin that doesn't spy on users and doesn't slow down you site.

== Description ==

Add simple share buttons under your posts or use the widget to add sharing to any widget area your theme provides. This plugin uses simple SVG icons for social network logos and small vanilla JavaScript to allow the user to share the current post or page. Share icons inherit their colours from the theme link colours to match the website design.

Why choose Minimal Share Buttons before other similar plugins?

* Minimal and elegant look that blends with your theme (tested with all latest default WordPress themes as well as with some other popular themes)
* Minimal impact on your site's performance - the plugin loads only a small SVG file with the icons, less than 1k CSS and 3.5ะบ unminified and uncompressed JavaScript - most of it to make SVG icons work in old browsers.
* Doesn't spy on your users - the plugin doesn't load any thitd-party scripts that record your user's activity on your site, doesn't set or read any cookies.
